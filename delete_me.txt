The Zombie Virus is a disease that completely takes over the host's body.
Players, villagers, and even some animals can become infected, being transformed into agressive husks.

When the victim is infected, they will start to attack any nearby players or villagers.
Zombies won't attack animals, but the animals can still be infected upon birth.

Fortunatly, a cure for this disease has been synthesized.
Infected villagers and animals can be cured with the Minor Infection Cure.

The Minor Infection Cure can be crafted with the following:

2x Syringe
1x Golden Ingot
3x Rotten Flesh
2x Carrot
1x Emerald

To use the Cure you must right click while holding it in your main hand.
The cure can be used to heal a player inflicted with the minor infection.
It can also be used to fully cure any infected villagers or animals!
