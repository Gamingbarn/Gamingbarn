                    <b>Added atlases folder</b><br>
                    An optimization feature added by Minecraft in 1.19.3<br>
                    This leads to faster resource pack loading speeds<br>
                    <br>

                <p>
                    <b>Made Auto Turrets set in center of block when placed</b><br>
                    Makes it easier align turrets nicely<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Monsters stop attacking turret once it's damaged</b><br>
                    When Auto Turret enters its damaged state, monsters will stop attacking it<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Added Destroyed Turret feature</b><br>
                    When Auto Turrets die they will now enter a Destroyed phase<br>
                    In this state, they are unable to receive further damaged<br>
                    The turret also loses its ability to be repaired<br>
                    The owner of the turret can salvage the turret from the turret_settings menu<br>
                    Salvaging turrets will give back some of the resources it took to craft the turret<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Fixed shotgun stat inconsistencies</b><br>
                    The shotgun range when the item was crafted stated the range was 19<br>
                    The shotgun range when the item was given stated the range was 30<br>
                    The shotgun range upon item update stated the range was 19<br>
                    The actual shotgun range was 15<br>
                    The new actual range is 22<br>
                    The shotgun damage in the tooltip everywhere stated it was 24<br>
                    The actual shotgun damage is 18<br>
                    How did this even happen<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Fixed Assault Laser Rifle Reload bug</b><br>
                    It was possible to reload the Assault Laser Rifle with full ammo<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Improved raycast system</b><br>
                    Lowered the margin for error with all gun projectiles<br>
                    Guns can no longer "shoot through walls"<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Improved give functions</b><br>
                    All functions from the give namespace now use the function under GBG<br>
                    Renamed all of the give functions to be the actual name of the item<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Removed flare gun texture files</b><br>
                    They were still in from way back<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Better organized texture files</b><br>
                    It was kind of a mess<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Organized sound files</b><br>
                    It was a huge mess<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Added bandage and syringe use sound effects</b><br>
                    I think they're good<br>

                    There was a bug where the ink blaster looked like the chem thrower when shot/reloaded<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Gave Auto Turrets water breathing</b><br>

                    Auto Turret health has been doubled<br>
                    Whenever an turret goes below half health it will gain 14 armor points but lose functionality<br>
                    Repair the turret in the /trigger turret_settings menu to make it operational again<br>
                    Upon death, the turret will drop a portion of the resources it takes to craft it.<br>

                    <br>
                    <b>Lowered Auto Turret damage from 5 to 3</b><br>

                    <b>Made Auto Turrets Permanent</b><br>

                    <br>
                    <b>Removed model and crafting files for flare and flare gun</b><br>
                    They were still in from V1.3<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Fixed Gun Crafting Book laser weapon bug</b><br>
                    There was a bug where the crafting recipe for the laser pistol was the laser rifle<br>
                    And that the recipe for the laser rifle was the laser cannon<br>
                    You will need to craft the items again to get them fixed<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Organized all crafting system files</b><br>
                    Organized the crafting recipes, functions, and advancements<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Fixed glass pane and tinted glass bug</b><br>
                    There was a bug where standard and laser guns couldn't shoot through glass panes or tinted glass<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Added Ray Gun: Red</b><br>
                    New Gun<br>
                    An automatic quick-firing ray gun<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Removed Combat shotgun</b><br>
                    It doesn't really fulfil a unique purpose<br>
                    Honestly, quite a forgettable gun<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Added Assault Laser Rifle</b><br>
                    A new automatic laser weapon<br>

                <p>
                    <b>Updated to 1.19</b><br>
                    Datapack now works on the latest Minecraft release<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Improved code organization</b><br>
                    Now it's easier on my end to view and edit the code<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Removed unnecessary scoreboards</b><br>
                    Changed code to not require them<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Optimized load.mcfunction</b><br>
                    Old system would run load.mcfunction every 1.5 sec, new system runs smaller function every 10 sec<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Optimized ALL right click detection</b><br>
                    Less stress on worlds with large amounts of players<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Optimized ammo display</b><br>
                    Less stress on worlds with large amounts of players<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Fixed c4 & land mine carrot stick bug</b><br>
                    If you looked at a land mine/c4 you could take the carrot stick from it to render it invisible<br>
                    Unfortunately, now c4s and land mines are no longer affected by gravity (will be fixed in future update)<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Fixed book result bug</b><br>
                    In the various crafting manuals sometimes the "result" portion of the page was cut off<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Fixed Laser Rifle ammo bug</b><br>
                    Laser rifles wouldn't consume ammo when reloading.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Fixed Flame Thrower ammo bug</b><br>
                    Flame Thrower canisters would be named flame thrower ammo if obtained through the give function<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Fixed Ink Blaster undead bug</b><br>
                    Undead mobs hit by the ink blaster would become stronger, instead of weaker<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Added give:syringe function</b><br>
                    The give command for the syringe was missing<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Removed robot toggle config functions</b><br>
                    They were still left over from when robots where still in gbg<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Ink Blaster now shoots through mobs</b><br>
                    More use for the ink blaster now<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Increased slowness effect with Ink Blaster</b><br>
                    Ink blaster is better now<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Changed models of the syringes</b><br>
                    They used a pretty odd system for displaying sprites before, this has been changed<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Nerfed Sniper Rifle Piercing</b><br>
                    When a sniper rifle shot pierces through an entity it will lose momentum<br>
                    Meaning that at shorter ranges it can pierce more than at longer ranges<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Nerfed Ray Gun: Blue range</b><br>
                    Seemed a little high, it has been lowered from 60 to 48<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Standard Guns now shoot through glass</b><br>
                    Most standard guns can now shoot through glass, breaking it in the process<br>
                    Auto turret cannot shoot through/break glass<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Laser Guns now shoot through glass</b><br>
                    All laser guns can now shoot through glass<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Added summon commands for various equipment</b><br>
                    Handy dandy little tool<br>
                    They can be summoned via the summon namespace<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Tweaked pistol model and texture</b><br>
                    Looks a little better now<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Changed image system for books</b><br>
                    The previous system relied on overriding custom characters, this has been changed to use a custom font instead<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Changed damage system for most standard, laser, and ray guns</b><br>
                    The system, instead of using effects, uses scoreboards to deal damage to players and mobs<br>
                    This allows for much more specific damage application<br>
                    As a result to this change, however, most guns have received damage nerfs<br>
                    The only bug is that absorption hearts are now ignored when dealing damage<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Added ErrorCraft's Score-Based-Damage Datapack</b><br>
                    This datapack is contained within the gbg zip file<br>
                    This datapack is responsible for making the player damage system work<br>

                    Huge thanks to ErrorCraft!<br>

                    <b>Fixed give:all_ammo bug</b><br>
                    The flamethrower Ammo and Rockets were only given in groupd of 1 instead of 64<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Fixed bullet raycast bug</b><br>
                    Bullets couldn't fire through small dripleaf or big dripleaf<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Added realistic gun sounds to most guns</b><br>

                    <br>
                    <b>Changed name of Flame Thrower Ammo to Flame Thrower Canister</b><br>
