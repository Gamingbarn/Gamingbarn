                When you see a regular zombie while playing Minecraft, you probably think nothing of it.<br>
                But when you see one of these zombies...<br>
                <i>You'll run.</i><br>
                -----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                This datapack completely changes the spawning mechanic for mobs.<br>
                No more non-zombie hostile mobs in the overworld.<br>
                Most hostile mobs will now spawn as zombies.<br>
                All zombies will spawn with more health, more attack damage, and faster speed.<br>
                But it doesn't end there.<br>
                There is a chance that pigs, cows, sheep, chickens, or even horses will spawn as zombified variants.<br>
                HOWEVER!<br>
                Zombies are very weak to fire!<br>
                They will die very quickly if on fire.<br>
                All zombies will also leave a trail of fire when they are on fire.<br>
                -----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                Don't die.<br>
                Dying will infect you with the zombie virus.<br>
                As a zombie you are slightly stronger and zombies will no longer attack you.<br>
                However, you have slowness, mining fatigue, and constant hunger.<br>
                So you may want to cure yourself fast.<br>
                Rumor has it that some zombies have even tried to cure themselves.<br>
                So they might have a special item on them when they die.<br>
                -----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                Death isn't the only way to get infected, however.<br>
                You also have a 25% chance of getting a minor infection when attacked by a zombie.<br>
                The minor infection is similar to the regular infection, but is temporary.<br>
                Only lasting for 3 minutes.<br>
                -----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                Swarm Zombie<br>
                -Regular Zombie<br>
                Nurse Zombie<br>
                -Drops gunpowder.<br>
                -Can heal up to 2 nearby zombies.<br>
                (When you have Gamingbarn's Guns installed they will drop various medical items.)<br>
                (Even cures.)<br>
                Psychopath Zombie<br>
                -Wields a special sword that it can drop on death.<br>
                -Because it has a sword it does more damage.<br>
                Scorched Zombie<br>
                -Is immune to fire.<br>
                (When you have Gamingbarn's Guns installed they will drop slightly more ammo.)<br>
                Builder Zombie<br>
                -Will build bridges and staircases to get to the nearest player.<br>
                Miner Zombie<br>
                -Will break blocks near itself to get to the nearest player.<br>
                Acid Spitter<br>
                -Will shoot acid at nearby players<br>
                Water Zombie<br>
                -All zombies will turn into water zombies if they remain in water for too long.<br>
                -They are just as good as regular zombies when on land.<br>
                -They are VERY fast when in water.<br>
                Water Spitter<br>
                -Will spit water projectiles at the nearest player. (These are weaker than the acid spit)<br>
                -They are just as good as regular zombies when on land.<br>
                -They are VERY fast when in water.<br>
                -----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                One more thing to mention.<br>
                When you hurt a zombie,<br>
                <i>All</i> nearby zombies will come to its aid.<br>
                -----------------------------------------------------------------<br>

                /function config:max_zombie_count_set_[number]<br>
                -----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                The books that zombies drop can be scrapped in the crafting grid for 3 rabbit hides.<br>
