                    <b>Removed Non-Despawning Drowned</b><br>
                    An old feature that made all drowned that spawned via conversion not despawn<br>
                    However, this feature also affected the naturally spawning drowned as well (from ocean ruins)<br>
                    This was an oversight, and the feature has been removed because of it<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Updated pack.png</b><br>

                    <b>Updated GBG cure book</b><br>
                    It was kind of outdated, stating features that no longer exist<br>

                    These Water Zombies wouldn't despawn either<br>
