                <h3><a href="downloads/gbg/V1.12/Gamingbarn's-Guns-UNZIP_ME.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">V1.12</a></h3>
                <p>
                    <b>Updated model for pistol, assault rifle, shotgun, and sniper rifle</b><br>
                    They all look better than before<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Tweaked models for pistol, shotgun, sniper rifle, and assault rifle ammo</b><br>
                    Made it easier to tell the difference between pistol and sniper rifle ammos<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Tweaked chemical thrower and ink blaster models</b><br>
                    Removed one of the canisters from the model<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Fixed ink blaster texture bug</b><br>
                    The ink blaster used to have the texture of the chemical thrower instead<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Organized all model files</b><br>
                    This will make adjustments, changes, and additions way easier<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Removed model and crafting files for flare and flare gun</b><br>
                    They were still in from V1.3<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Fixed Gun Crafting Book laser weapon bug</b><br>
                    There was a bug where the crafting recipe for the laser pistol was the laser rifle<br>
                    And that the recipe for the laser rifle was the laser cannon<br>
                    You will need to craft the items again to get them fixed<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Organized all crafting system files</b><br>
                    Organized the crafting recipes, functions, and advancements<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Fixed glass pane and tinted glass bug</b><br>
                    There was a bug where standard and laser guns couldn't shoot through glass panes or tinted glass<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Added Ray Gun: Red</b><br>
                    New Gun<br>
                    An automatic quick-firing ray gun<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Removed Combat shotgun</b><br>
                    It doesn't really fulfil a unique purpose<br>
                    Honestly, quite a forgettable gun<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Added Assault Laser Rifle</b><br>
                    A new automatic laser weapon<br>
